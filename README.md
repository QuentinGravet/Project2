# Project ETL

### Group Members: Melody Liou, Quentin Gravet

## Finding Data: Use at least 2 sources

•  The sources of data that you will extract from.

*	Kaggle

•  The type of transformation needed for this data (cleaning, joining, filtering, aggregating, etc).

* Extract: your original data sources and how the data was formatted (CSV, JSON, pgAdmin 4, etc).

* Transform: what data cleaning or transformation was required.

•  The type of final production database to load the data into (relational or non-relational).

*	Relational databases represent and store data in tables and rows

*	Non-relational databases represent data in collections of JSON documents

*	Load: the final database, tables/collections, and why this was chosen.

•  The final tables or collections that will be used in the production database.

•  You will be required to submit a final technical report with the above information and steps required to reproduce your ETL process.
